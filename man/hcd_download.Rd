\examples{
f <- hcd_download(1707, timescale = "monthly")
file.exists(f)

## specifying multiple storage folders
dirs <- file.path(tempdir(), c("2855", "1707"))
dir.create(dirs[1])
dir.create(dirs[2])
f <- hcd_download(c(2855, 1707), timescale = "monthly", dir = dirs)
file.exists(f)
## ...and daily
f <- hcd_download(c(2855, 1707), timescale = "daily", dir = dirs,
                  year = 1999:2000)
file.exists(f)
